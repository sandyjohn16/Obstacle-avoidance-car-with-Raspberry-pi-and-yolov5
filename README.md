# Obstacle-avoidance-car-with-Raspberry-pi-and-yolov5
uses advanced object detection models and sensor integration approaches to tackle the problem of real-time obstacle avoidance in indoor environments. The complexity of dynamic and noisy environments may result in difficulties for traditional obstacle identification techniques, which frequently rely on basic sensors or pre-defined maps.
